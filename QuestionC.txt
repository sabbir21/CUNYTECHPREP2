question C

/* use HashMap<String, Set<String>>, one key and values as collection Set  so we can store unique multiple values; data structure to save URL
Trim the URL www.youtube.com/sssd/sddd into domain and URI (we don't need to split protocol,domain, port, uri differently.
As for example key will be www.youtube.com and values will be all URI in sets . 
So Through key and from value(set.contains(?) ) we can search for visited or not visited and save the URI of the URL.
So domain will be saved once here and all the URI will be connected. So space minimization.
But if we skip visited url's then there might be chance over time the contents might get changed. So therefor we can use priority flag over visited sites.
